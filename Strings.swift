var normal = "madam"

var reverse = normal.reversed() // It is a ReversedCollection<String> type and not a String one
normal == reverse // return an error

var reverse_right = String(normal.reversed())
normal == reverse_right // returns true

/*
Converting strings to all-lowercase or all-uppercase is great when you want user input to be case-insensitive. 
And reversing a string is useful if you want to see if two strings are palindromes. Note in the last example, 
we need to use str.reversed() with a String initializer. If you look closely at the documentation for reversed(), 
you'll see that it actually returns a ReversedCollection instead of a String. You won't need to use this type directly, 
but just know that Swift uses it "under the hood" for efficiency. You can simply use the String() initializer to convert 
the result into a usable string.

// REPLACING SUBSTRINGS
/*
We can also modify the middle of strings. A common manipulation method is replacingOccurrences(of: String, with: String), 
which allows us to swap out one substring with another.

// FOUR WAYS TO INITIATE AND ARRAY

// The full type name
var numbers = Array<Double>()

// The short type name
var moreNumbers = [Double]()

// Array literal syntax
let differentNumbers = [97.4, 99.0, 100.0]

// Array that is preinitialized with a fixed number of default values -> Array(repeating: value, count: value)
var digitCounts = Array(repeating: 0, count: 20)
